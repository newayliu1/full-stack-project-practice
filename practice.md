google machine if you need further assistance.

## Plan your tables and columns

What tables will you need? What will the columns on the table be?

## Create an ERD (entity relationship diagram)

These are the diagrams that show how your tables are related to one another.
(one to many, many to many, ect).

## Routing

What routes will you need to be able to make the proper request to your API?

## 3rd Party APIs

Do you plan to use any, if so what are they?

## Wireframes

Please create a wireframe of your planned front end.

## Timetable

Write a basic timetable for yourself, you don't have to stick to it but it
helps to go in with a plan.
